# Anagram Groups
#
# Given an array of strings strs, group all anagrams together into sublists.
# You may return the output in any order.
# An anagram is a string that contains the exact same characters as another string,
# but the order of the characters can be different.
#
# Example 1:
# Input: strs = ["act","pots","tops","cat","stop","hat"]
# Output: [["hat"],["act", "cat"],["stop", "pots", "tops"]]
#
# Example 2:
# Input: strs = ["x"]
# Output: [["x"]]
#
# Example 3:
# Input: strs = [""]
# Output: [[""]]
